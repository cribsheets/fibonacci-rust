    // in rust, the 0th argument is the string used to invoke the program.
    // we want the 1st argument, and we then need to convert it to an i32, as
    // rust is strongly typed

    // read a single argument n, and compute F(n) where:

    // - F(0) = 0
    // - F(1) = 1
    // - F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
